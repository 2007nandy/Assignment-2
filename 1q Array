Output:
Array index out of range!

Explanation:
The statement arr[3] tries to access the 4th element of an array that only has indices 0–2.
Hence, an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs first — the division by zero never executes because the program already failed at array access.
Therefore, the second catch block executes.
